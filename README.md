I'm R0ck3t, a code whisperer by day and a bug exterminator by night. When I'm not busy trying to convince my code to work, you can find me:

    🧩 Puzzling over complex algorithms (and why they always seem to break).
    ☕️ Fueling my caffeine addiction one coffee cup at a time.
    🚀 Dreaming about launching the next big thing (or at least my latest side project).

My superpowers include:

    Turning coffee into code.
    Debugging like a ninja.
    Writing documentation... just kidding, who likes that?
